---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 1. Designing the fastening straps holes
> - Using sketch and mirror in designing the holes for the fastening straps on the forearm part of the exoskeleton.
### 2. Model clearance for hardware components assembly (Raspberry Pi)
> - Model clearance;
> - Design the holes for the screws that will hold in place the raspberry pi to the exoskeleton.
### 3. Model clearance for for assembling hardware components (Servomotor)
> - Model clearance;
> - Design the screw holes that will hold in place the servomotor and the rod.
### 4. Model clearance for assembling hardware components (Muscle sensor)
> - Model clearance;
> - Design a mounting part to place the muscle sensor on the exoskeleton.
### 5. Import screws and nuts from MC Master component
> - Use MC Master catalog to import real size screws and nuts for our projects.
### 6. Add appearance
> - Learn how to add suitable appearances on your 3D model. From plastic, glass to metal, appearances help us to better communicate our final product.
### 7. Advanced appearance
> - Adding texture and highlights on our models using advance appearance.
### 8. Add scene setup, decals and render online
> - Preparing the 3D model for rendering;
> - Setting up the scene and adding decals;
> - Rendering the model to see a more realistic version of it.
### 9. Cloud render and turn tables
> - Cloud render comes in hand when our computers are not powerful enough and help us have good qualitative renderings;
> - Creating a turn table, we can get a video or a .GIF with the model from all the angles.
### 10. Adding and animating joints
> - Replicate the motion of our prototype;
> - Create a motion study.
