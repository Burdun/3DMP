---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 1. Course objectives
> - Presenting the subjects that will be covered during this semester.
### 2. The course motivation
> - Present UnibucRobotics our projects and other courses roadmap;
> - Presenting the 3D printers.
### 3. Administrative concerns
> - Details about registration, grading, attendance, and why is the course in English.
### 4. Why 3D modeling
> - Presenting the benefits of learning 3D modeling.
### 5. Why 3D printing
> - Presenting a brief history of 3D printing and the benefits of learning 3D modeling.
### 6. Parametric modeling
> - Parametric modeling is an approach to 3D CAD in which you capture design intent using features and constraints, and this allows users to automate repetitive changes, such as those found in families of product parts.
### 7. Direct modeling
> - After you finished the sketches you can add nice touches using direct modeling.
### 8.  Freeform modeling & sculpting
> - Create a hanger for the box using free form modeling tools.
### 9. Assembly modeling
> - Add as build joints to mimic the sliding functionality that the box will have.
### 10.  Prepare model for 3D printing
> - Save the 3D model as STL file to slice it for 3D printing.
