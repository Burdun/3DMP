### 1. Leonardo da Vinci's Spatial Slider-Crank mechanism
> - Overview of Spatial Slider-Crank mechanism designed by Leonardo da Vinci.
### 2. Create canvas from already existing CAD project
> - If you want to design a mechanism that already exists on the internet you just need to import it in Fusion.
### 3. Compare objects' dimensions in perspective view - Part 1
> - In front, side or top view it's simple to compare the objects' dimensions because they are on the same plane. When it comes to perspective view, we need to project the objects on the same plane before taking the measurements.
### 4. Compare objects' dimensions in perspective view - Part 2
> - In front, side or top view it's simple to compare the objects' dimensions because they are on the same plane. When it comes to perspective view, we need to project the objects on the same plane before taking the measurements.
### 5. Project mechanism's components on one single plane
> - If you don't have a reference project or canvases for your mechanism, but you have a perspective photo, you can start your sketch by measuring the objects from the photo;
> - Using perspective guideline we will project in this video all the object to the side plane.
### 6. Get the mechanism's dimensions from Da Vinci's sketch
> - With the perspective lines marked and the objects projected on the same plane, we can use Fusion to measure the mechanism's objects from the image.
### 7. Divide the project into components and sketch the references
> - Before starting a project, it's a good idea to divide it into components to have an overview of what are the steps to create the mechanism;
> - Instead of canvas make two sketches from the side and top view.
### 8. Create the holder
> - Design the mechanism's components holder;
> - Using parametric modeling, we start from a sketch, we extrude it, and then we direct edit the objects.
### 9. Create the crank
> - Design the crank and its teeth;
> - Using parametric modeling, we start from a sketch, we extrude it, and then we direct edit the objects.
### 10. Create the main axis using coil tool
> - Using the coil tool we will create the main axis and the snail that will power the crank's teeth;
> - Using parametric modeling, we start from a sketch, we extrude it, and then we direct edit the objects.
