### 1. Bodies vs Components
> - Bodies and Components are different ways to organize a design. Understanding the differences between them helps knowing when to use which.
### 2. Good practices when modeling in Fusion 360
> - Name your components;
> - Fusion 360 Rule No.1;
> - Capture history.
### 3. Rapid Prototyping
> - Heads up on the following videos;
> - Importance of rapid prototyping and why it is essential in today's tech environment.
### 4. Attach and calibrate canvas
> - Inserting multiple canvases to create a template in figuring out the shape of the 3D model.
### 5. 2D Sketch using canvas and dimensions
> - The key in 3D modeling is starting from simple 2D shapes that combined form the complex 3D model. We exercise by starting from simple rectangles and draw according to the canvases.
### 6. Creating a 3D model from the 2D sketch
> - Extrude the correct sketches to obtain the 3D model. Having extruded the Parametric sketch we can start the Direct Editing.
### 7. Import references
> - Importing existing models and using them as references in sculpting our own 3D model.
### 8. Place and align the imported references (Raspberry Pi)
> - Place and align the Raspberry Pi component.
### 9. Place and align the imported references (Muscle sensor)
> - Place and align the muscle sensor component.
### 10. Place and align the imported references (Servomotor)
> - Place and align the servomotor component.
