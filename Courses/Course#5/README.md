### 1. Rotational to Linear Motion and Vice-Versa - Crank and Slotted Link Mechanism
> - Overview of Crank and Slotted Link Mechanism;
> - Components, how it works and real life usage.
### 2. Crank and Slotted Link - The mechanism holder and the crank
> - Design the mechanism holder and the crank component;
> - Using parametric modeling, we start from a sketch, extrude it and then direct edit the objects.
### 3. Crank and Slotted Link - The mechanism holder and the linear slider
> - Design the slider component and edit the holder to put the slider in place;
> - Using parametric modeling, we start from a sketch, we extrude it and then we direct edit the objects.
### 4. Crank and Slotted Link - The slotted bar and contact pins
> - Design the slotted link;
> - Add the contact pins on crank and slider, so together with the slotted link, can bring the mechanism to life;
> - Using parametric modeling, we start from a sketch, we extrude it and then we direct edit the objects.
### 5. Crank and Slotted Link - Appearance, Joints, contact sets and motion study
> - Now that all the components are done, we can add the appearance, create the joints, add the contact sets and test the mechanism by creating a motion study.
### 6. Rotational to Linear Motion and Vice-Versa - Slider Crank Mechanism
> - Overview of Slider Crank Mechanism;
> - Components, how it works and real life usage.
### 7. Slider Crank Mechanism - The mechanism holder, the crank and the slider
> - Using Fusion Rule Number 1, design the mechanism holder, the crank and the slider;
> - Everything will start from a sketch and then will be extruded or direct edited.
### 8. Slider Crank Mechanism - Continue the mechanism holder
> - Continue the mechanism holder putting the crank and the slider in place;
> - Using parametric modeling, we start from a sketch, we extrude it and then we direct edit the objects.
### 9. Slider Crank Mechanism - The connecting rod and the contact pins
> - Design the connecting rod;
> - Add the contact pins on crank and slider, so together with the rod, can bring the mechanism to life;
> - Using parametric modeling, we start from a sketch, we extrude it and then we direct edit the objects.
### 10. Slider Crank Mechanism: Printing optimization, Appearance and Motion Study
> - Now that all the components are ready, we add the appearance, create the joints and test the mechanism by creating a motion study.
