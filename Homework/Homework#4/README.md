# 3DMP -  Homework no. 4

### Tasks:
1. Watch and understand the course videos about Rotational to Linear Motion and Vice-Versa mechanisms (we recommend to model them on your own as well).
2. Design the Scotch Yoke Mechanism, taking the course videos as reference (especially the slider crank mechanism; in this one can see why it’s important to use Fusion Rule Number 1)
3. Choose ONE mechanism from the next list and design it in Fusion:

4. (BONUS) Make a video rendering with the mechanism displaying the motion study. Use the result to make a video tutorial where you present how the mechanism is working.

Requirements for 2 and 3:
- Divide the mechanism into components;
- Use Fusion Rule Number 1;
- Design the model having in mind that it will be 3D printed (create a stand for the mechanism - like “Holder” component made in Course 5 videos - so they will not levitate);
- Use suggestive names for your bodies, components, sketches, joints, contact points, construction planes or any element that you include in your project;
- Add appearances;
- Add joints;
- Create a motion study;
- Render the mechanism (upload a rendering photo to GitHub as well).

OBS: Turn on capture history. You need to upload the project as .f3d and a .stl for each projects’ body and component.
