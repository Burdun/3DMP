### 1. How to align sketches
> - Learn how we can align the smaller pieces of a sketch, even if they are basic shapes, custom shapes, or custom text.
### 2. Creating a 3D model after a technical drawing (1)
> - Use parametric modeling to create a 3D model based on a technical drawing (A1).
### 3. Creating a 3D model after a technical drawing (2)
> - Use parametric modeling to create a 3D model based on a technical drawing (A4).
### 4. Importing and using SVG files
> - Importing SVG files into Fusion; 
> - Extruding the resulting sketch using both Cut and Join operations;
> - Creating a model based on an SVG file.
### 5. How to create more patterns
> - Learn what types of patterns we can make using Fusion and what advantages and disadvantages they have.
